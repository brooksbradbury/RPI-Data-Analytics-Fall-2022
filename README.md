# RPI-Data-Analytics-Fall-2022
Old R files from my Data Analytics class in Fall 2022

This is a repository created to demonstrate my R programming skills from when I took Data Analytics at RPI while pursuing my Masters Degree.
There will be multiple programs that I hope to get around to uploading that demonstrate my capabilities in R
